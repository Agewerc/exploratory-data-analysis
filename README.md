# Exploratory Data Analysis

This project was developed in the unit Introduction to Data Science of the Master of Data Science from Monash University. We develop an extensive exploratory data analysis about cryptocurrencies, Immigration and crimes in Australia. 

We use primarily pandas in python. The file `EDA.ipynb` contains the analysis and all others are supporting dataset.


## Data
The following data files used in this task were originally downloaded from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/):
