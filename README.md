# Exploratory Data Analysis

This project was developed in the unit Introduction to Data Science of the Mastre of Data Science from Monash University. We develop an extensive exploratory data analysis about cryptocurrencies, Immigration and crimes in Australia. 

We use primarily pandas in python. The file `EDA.ipynb` contains the analysis and all others are supporting dataset.

A polynomial equation of third degree is the best way to model the data of births in Australia.
over the exercise we were able to explore why linear regressions do not fit complex and cyclical relations between variables. A polynomial equation suits this data because it is able to capture this complex trend.

## Exploratory Analysis of Criptocurrency Prices

Bitcoin has always been the most popular cryptocurrency. It was the first one and some people are still confused thinking cryptocurrencies, blockchain and bitcoin are the same thing. Due to its popularity, Bitcoin prices are much higher than all other cryptocurrencies.
This is why we cannot compare criptocurrencies prices over time, the scale between currencies is completely difficult. However, its possible to compare the trend of prices over time, and this is possible putting all currencies in the same scale.
